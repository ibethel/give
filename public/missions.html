She believes Spain has seen so much religion that is restrictive and controversial. A fresh view of what grace is and how the word can set people free is quite refreshing and attractive, especially during this time of economic impact. People are searching for something tangible. The gift of peace, love, security, and grace is much needed and appreciated.</p>

They empower missionaries by radically redefining courage and wisdom while in the midst of uncertainty. Cameron has been training the U.S. Military Special Ops community since shortly after September 11, 2001 on survival tactics. Their heart is to impart the same elite training, but with a supernatural approach for those who dare to pierce the darkness with the light of the Gospel. They work closely with Bethel missions, BSSM short-term missions, high-risk ministries involved with human trafficking and churches globally. Additionally, they offer in-country resolution for missionaries and ministries that are facing serious threats by traveling to the source of the problem in order to aid.</p>
