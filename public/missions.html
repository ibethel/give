A fresh view of what grace is and how the word can set people free is quite refreshing and attractive, especially during this time of economic impact. People are searching for something tangible. The gift of peace, love, security, and grace is much needed and appreciated.</p>

                                  Bob and Kimberly Johnson are the founders and directors of Extreme Love, an organization determined to see a world without orphans. Their passion is to see people become who they were truly created to be and to see orphans become sons and daughters. For more than a decade, Bob and Kimberly took to the streets of San Francisco and encouraged the homeless, drug addicts and prostitutes. After Bob had an impactful encounter with a girl who'd been trafficked, he and Kimberly began traveling to other nations in Asia and Africa to share love and give aid to those in need. With their unique personalities, it came naturally for Bob and Kimberly to step in and be a father and mother to the fatherless. Extreme Love is focused on creating a model of sustainability for orphan care in the U.S. and worldwide. Alongside their international projects, Bob and Kimberly are currently working to make Redding a city with no more orphans.
